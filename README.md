# Visualizer-Preferences
This is the Visualizer app of Udacity. I've made the Preference settings screen of the app using PreferenceScreen, PreferenceFragmentCompat and SharedPreferences classes. The user could choose whether to show the bass, mid and the treble lines or not. They can also choose the color and the size of the shapes of the visualizers.
